    <h2>Glutes</h2>
    <section>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>The gluteal muscles are among the largest in your body, providing hip stability and aiding in movement. Strong glutes support your lower back and contribute to better posture. They are also essential for athletic performance.</p>

        <h3>Nutrition Tips</h3>
        <p>Focus on protein-rich foods like lean meats, beans, and legumes to support muscle growth. Incorporate complex carbohydrates for energy during workouts, and donâ€™t forget healthy fats. A balanced diet is key to maintaining strong glute muscles.</p>

            <h4>Glute Bridges</h4>
            <p>Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Lift your hips upward by squeezing your glutes until your body forms a straight line from shoulders to knees. Hold briefly before lowering slowly.</p>

            <h4>Donkey Kicks</h4>
            <p>Start on all fours with a flat back. Lift one leg towards the ceiling while contracting your glutes, then lower it without touching the floor. Repeat several reps before switching legs.</p>

            <h4>Squats</h4>
            <p>Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and lower into a squat as if sitting into an invisible chair. Keep your knees behind your toes and your back straight. Rise back up by engaging your glutes for each repetition.</p>
